Subject: **September Achievements: CJOC Dynamic Agent Enhancements, PVC Fixes, and Streamlined Docker Image Build Process**

**Report on Recent Tasks Completed**

1. **Maven Installation and Configuration of Custom M2 Repository:**
   I took the responsibility of installing Maven on the dynamic agent pod base image. In addition to the installation, I created a customized `settings.xml` file for the Maven repository. This configuration ensures that the dynamic agents in our environment have access to the specific Maven repositories required for the build process. By doing this, I enabled smooth dependency resolution during the build, particularly for jobs requiring custom or internal repositories.

2. **Resolution of PVC, PV, and StorageClass Challenges:**
   I successfully addressed the challenges related to Persistent Volume (PV), Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), and StorageClass (SC) in our dynamic agent workspace setup. After analyzing the root cause of the storage issues, I fixed the configuration and successfully mounted the PVC for the dynamic agent workspaces. This allowed the agents to persist build data across job executions as needed, contributing to a more stable and resilient build environment.

3. **Fixing Docker-in-Docker (DinD) Issue for Docker Image Build:**
   I resolved the Docker-in-Docker (DinD) issue, which was impacting our ability to build Docker images from JAR files generated by the Maven build. The issue involved configuring Docker in the dynamic agents so that the Maven build outputs could be properly packaged into Docker images. With this fix, the process of building Docker images based on the Maven JAR files was successfully streamlined, ensuring the build pipeline ran efficiently without interruptions.

4. **Podman Installation and Socket Service Configuration on Jumpbox:**
   I was responsible for installing Podman on the jumpbox and configuring the `podman.socket` service. I enabled and started the `podman.socket` service, allowing the jumpbox to communicate with Podman remotely. This setup was critical for building Docker images, tagging them, and pushing them to Artifactory. The transition to using Podman instead of Docker resolved the company's policy restrictions related to Docker socket volume mounts, ensuring compliance with internal security policies while maintaining the integrity of the image build and deployment processes.
