ChromeDriver must match the version of Chrome installed on the Windows node. If Chrome updates automatically but youâ€™re still using an older version of ChromeDriver, this mismatch can cause your automation jobs to fail.

Check the Chrome and ChromeDriver Versions:

Find out which version of Chrome is installed on the node by typing chrome://version in the browser.
Ensure that the ChromeDriver version matches. You can find the compatible versions of ChromeDriver from ChromeDriver's version page.
Action:

Download and install the correct version of ChromeDriver that matches your version of Chrome.
Replace the current chromedriver.exe in your project with the correct version, or automate its download using a tool like WebDriverManager.
